  Step 1: Share the Python File
  You need to give the other person the Python script file.
   * File to share: carbon_footprint_calculator.py

  You can share it via email, a USB drive, or a cloud service like Google Drive or Dropbox.

  Step 2: Ensure They Have Python Installed
  The other computer must have Python installed to run the script.
   1. They can check if they have it by opening their terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and typing:
   1     python --version
      or
   1     python3 --version
   2. If they don't have it, they can download it for free from the official Python website: python.org. They should download the latest stable version.
      During installation on Windows, it's important to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".



  Once they have Python installed and have your .py file, they can run it the same way you do. They just need to:
   1. Open a terminal or Command Prompt.
   2. Navigate to the directory where they saved the carbon_footprint_calculator.py file.
   3. Run the command:

   1     python3 carbon_footprint_calculator.py
      (Or just python instead of python3 depending on their system.)
